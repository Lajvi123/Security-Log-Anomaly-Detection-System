# Security-Log-Anomaly-Detection-System
Build a system that collects simulated security logs and detects anomalies in real time using statistical and ML techniques.

To develop a real-time anomaly detection system that identifies and visualizes suspicious network activity by simulating log streams from the UNSW-NB15 dataset. 

##Dataset

I have used [UNSW-NB15 dataset](https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/unsw-nb15-dataset), which is a network intrusion dataset. It contains nine different attacks, includes DoS, worms, Backdoors, and Fuzzers. I have specifically utilised [`UNSW-NB15_1.csv`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xs8676kjZX8y5oVjiCplZL5zdQPTfk0j/view?usp=sharing) containing key network-level attributes and a `label` column for ground truth.
